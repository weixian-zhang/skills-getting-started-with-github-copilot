## Summary

This repository contains a sample **High School Management System API** built with FastAPI. The application allows students at Mergington High School to view available extracurricular activities and sign up for them. It includes in-memory data storage for activities like Chess Club, Programming Class, and Gym Class, with endpoints for listing activities and managing student signups.

This project serves as a practical example for learning and exploring GitHub Copilot capabilities while working with Python and FastAPI.
